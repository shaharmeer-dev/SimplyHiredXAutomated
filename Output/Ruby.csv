SFR3 is a boutique real estate investment fund managing $2B+ of affordable single-family homes. The Fund renovates distressed homes, using software-driven operations to run many “tertiary” markets concurrently. Today we own 10,500+ homes in 20 states.

You
You love building software that directly enables your team to crack critical business challenges. You've shipped production applications and can strike the right balance between shipping fast for immediate impact and long-term vision. You enjoy working remotely along with the independence and responsibility that comes with that.
Real estate is the world's largest asset class, but experience in the domain is not required. What is necessary is motivation to dive in and understand the work people do every day so you can build the right tools that give them leverage. The idea of building & running a $150M/yr business that operates like a startup, growing at 5-7%/yr (not a startup looking for PMF) is exciting to you.
What You'll Do
Buying, renovating, and managing a portfolio of thousands of homes worth billions of dollars is a big task. Our team is continuously experimenting to improve efficiency and accelerate operations.
You'll join a pod that consists of seasoned business owners paired with product and have complete ownership over a domain to to crank out needle moving features weekly. There's a lot for a small team to do, so we look for “T-shaped” engineers. You should be comfortable and confident across any stack, but also have deep expertise in one or more areas where you can be the team expert.
To manage single-family rentals at our scale, we write lots of software that runs our operations. For this dev pod, our users are hundreds of employees and vendors located in 40+ markets who renovate homes, repair issues for residents, and prepare our vacant homes for the next move-in.
In this role, you will:
Leverage cutting-edge AI to accelerate development. You'll experiment with and adopt modern AI tools—like large language models, code-generation platforms, and automation frameworks—to rapidly prototype features, streamline workflows, and continuously innovate. This culture of experimentation and speed ensures we stay ahead of the curve and deliver high-impact products faster.
Design and develop backend systems that power our field and property management operations. You'll build robust and scalable services that integrate with both our in house developed solution and external SaaS whether it be a reliable ledger or AI driven resource optimization models.
Integrate with third-party APIs (REST, GraphQL, etc.) to enhance our platforms and ensure seamless communication between different services.
Collaborate on scoping and prioritizing the roadmap. We constantly ship and evaluate new problems and opportunities to improve workflows. You'll regularly interact with users, ship fast, and help define our long-term tech vision—making trade-offs between effort and impact to focus on the most critical work.
Analyze system efficiency and performance. We're committed to continuous improvement and optimization. You'll use data to monitor software performance and identify opportunities that drive business results and enhance system reliability.
Your Stats
You'll be working across multiple backend projects. You might be a great fit if these attributes describe you:
Experience building backend systems that drive real-world processes and results.
Strong expertise in Python; React, Java and Ruby on Rails knowledge is a plus.
Hands-on experience with Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming.
Deep knowledge of AWS and cloud-based services.
Understanding the benefits and tradeoffs of different databases and their setups including PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis and DynamoDB..
