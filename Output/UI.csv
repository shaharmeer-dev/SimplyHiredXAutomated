Below is an outline of how the hiring process moves forward from here.
Screening Question(s) - If we like what we see on your resume, you will receive a request to answer a preliminary screening question. Responses are then reviewed by the hiring manager, and interviewees are selected based on responses.
Phone Interview - Typically conducted by our CXO, this phone interview is a 15-20 minute phone conversation where we look to learn more about you, your background, and what you're looking for in your next role.
Zoom Interview - The hiring manager and a member of our leadership team will meet with you via Zoom for 30 minutes, and you will be asked more in-depth and sometimes technical questions to determine your fit for the precise opening on the team based on current needs.
Second Zoom Interview - Except in rare circumstances, this is the final round of interviews. This round is conducted over Zoom by a member of our leadership team and is designed to determine the best fit of any remaining candidates for the position.


The process can sometimes seem a little cumbersome and even lengthy, but we care about ourselves and you as a potential fit. If you do get the job, we’ll do our best to make sure it’s one you’ll never want to leave."
